A repository for our EECE Capstone Project: Analog Computer, at Binghamton University.

## Introduction

Our project is an Analog Computer, capable of solving single-order differential equations with constant coefficients. The device is made up of several analog circuits, a custom power supply, and a microcontroller which controls the digital components and memory. This repository concerns itself with the code which will be implemented in the microcontroller.
